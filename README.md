To import this project in Eclipse, clone it and import the project, using the URI.

This page <http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseGit/article.html#clone-an-existing-repository> reports how to import an Eclipse project from a git repository.

## Import project in IntelliJ IDEA

From an open instance of IDEA, to clone a project and import ("open") it you can follow these instructions <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/setting-up-a-local-git-repository.html#cloneExistingRepository>.
Otherwise, from the startup window of IDEA, the same procedure can be activated from the menu `Check out from Version Control -> Git`.

> Do not use `Check out from Version Control -> Github`, since it will look for *your* Github projects and will require the Github login credentials.
